# Meteo Information
A small project developed by myself to gain a deeper understanding of working with data and JSON using Python.

# Usage
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:
```
python3 app.py
```

Afterward, you can access the web app locally using your preferred web browser.

# Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to dedicate efforts towards enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of the HTML pages.
By improving the design and layout, I intend to create a more engaging and user-friendly experience for the web app.
